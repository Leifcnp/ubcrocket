As we near our competition date, when the team will be travelling down to New Mexico to attend the <a href = "http://www.soundingrocket.org/2017-irec.html" target="_blank">Spcaeport America Cup 2017</a>, it's important to reflect on what we have accomplished and look forward to what we have yet to learn. Here are some updates approximately one month before the launch date!

<h3>Past Events</h3>


<h4>APEBBC EG Fest, held on March 11</h4>

This past March, we were fortunate enough to be invited out to <a href = "https://www.apeg.bc.ca/" target="_blank">APEG BC</a>’s Annual Engineering and Geoscience festival. This one day event was held in Vancouver Public Library (VPL) on March 12, 2017 to extend public knowledge of our profession and to celebrate of National Engineering and Geoscience Month.

Thousands of people passed through VPL promenade that day to learn more about the different booths, demonstrations and exhibitions present. Needless to say, there was never a shortage of people at our booth all day long. 

As UBC’s only rocketry team building our momentum in our inaugural year, it was awesome to see how our passion in rocketry resonated with fellow Vancouverites. People from various backgrounds and age groups stopped by to learn more about what it takes to build a rocket and how we are doing it. In particular, many people found interest in our manufacturing techniques: carbon fibre for the rocket body, 3D printing for the nose cone and other methods for internal components. 

We really enjoyed connecting with the community beyond the UBC campus and it was great to see the interest in engineering and rocketry. Thank you once again to APEG BC for inviting us out and we hope to see all of you again soon!

<h4>Critical Design Review, held on March 12</h4>

A Critical Design Review (CDR) is a technical progress review of our system to ensure that performance requirements are met within cost, schedule and risk. This past March, we held our first CDR in preparation for our competition, Spaceport America Cup 2017, in June. 

This year, we were pleased to host some of our sponsors and community supports as CDR panelists. These industry professionals came out on their own time to come out and support UBC Rocket; some even travelled all the way from Victoria to make it out on a Sunday morning! Big thank you to <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.ca/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.urthecast.com/" target="_blank">Urthecast</a>, and <a href="http://www.mech.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC Mechanical Engineering</a>!

We gained many valuable lessons throughout the process. Ever since the official team formation at the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, this was the first time all our subteams sat down together to integrate our efforts to prepare for a single purpose. With a goal in mind, the CDR helped get the entire team on the same page in having the big picture in mind. 

We timed the CDR so that it was between our design and manufacturing phase. This was extremely beneficial because we could still easily change and improve our design without wasting resources. Moreover, the valuable technical feedback that we received is already being actively integrated into our design revisions and manufacturing. 

Outside of engineering details, we also learned important and necessary engineering soft skills. Writing the technical preparation document gave us a chance to practice writing up technical information concisely and in a readable format. Additionally, team members were able to show off their technical presentation skills in front of a panel of experts.

Overall, the CDR taught us many important engineering lessons that we will continue improve on. It was also great to finally be able to connect with our sponsors and community supporters in person beyond just emails and phone calls. Most importantly, our team would not be able to follow our passion and do what we love to do without our amazing sponsors. They truly empowering the next generation of engineers and giving us the opportunity to build our engineering skillsets. 

Thank you once again to those who came out to CDR and our sponsors and community partners for your continuous support! We will continue to work hard in completing our rocket in the coming few weeks.

<h4>Okanagan Drop Test </h4>

After manufacturing some of our design, it was time to put it to the test! 

Two weeks ago, we took a short section of our rocket to test the recovery deployment mechanism in the Okanagan where we could get an open area, large drop and safe environment away from people and buildings. 

In this test, the key performance indicators were if the parachute mechanism deployed properly, if the parachute inflated properly and if our observations matched our previously determined coefficient of drag. 

We did five drops off a trestle and had a camera set up far in the distance to observe the drop. Inside our prototyped, we had our parachute packed inside alongside black powder that we ignited to separate a cap to pull out the parachute.

At this test, we qualified our rocket parachute deployment system almost fully with 100% success. It was super exciting to see our parachute deploy! Previously we tested our parachute in the wind tunnel on campus to get an preliminary coefficient of drag. This time around, we were able to confirm that the coefficient of drag on one of our four parachutes. The next drop test, we are confident that we can confirm the coefficient of drag for all our parachutes.

<h3>Team Updates</h3>

<h4>Avionics</h4>

 Within these few months, the Avionics team has tested all the hardware to be printed onto the PCB (printed circuit board), which contains the ignition, CPU, actuator, and more. This includes testing the accelerometer, which will be used during the rocket’s liftoff as measuring the acceleration will produce the most useful altitude data. The pressure sensors was also tested, which will be primarily used near the rocket’s apogee (highest point of a rocket’s ascent) where the pressure differences, and not the acceleration of the rocket, will produce the most useful altitude data. Additionally, Avionics has tested its state machine and the code that will trigger and monitor certain events during the rocket’s flight. The team anticipates to have more testing to be performed closer to the launch date through a model rocket test, where the team is able to collect representational data to improve the electronic components of the rocket.

<h4>Aerostructures</h4>

After integrating the feedback from CDR, our aerostructures team has been busy manufacturing the rocket components. Our body is composed of two separate carbon fibre body tubes and a 3D printed nose cone and fins. The carbon fibre body tubes are made and they are sanding it down for the paint job. The nose cone has been printed and we are considering the paint options. The fins are currently being printed and we are keeping our fingers cross for a successful print! They are also working closely with our payloads team to fit their structures inside the rocket, with our recovery team to ensure a smooth deploy of our recovery mechanism.

<h4>Recovery</h4>

Currently, the Recovery team is working to improve the parachute design and mitigate any potential problems that may arise during the deployment of the parachute. Using data collected from the Okanagan drop test, the team was able to locate an issue with the packing of the parachute and organization of the wires. Another goal of the team is to ensure that the rocket reaches apogee (highest point of a rocket’s ascent) and deploy the parachute before the rocket reaches the ground. The team is also working on the release mechanism that will deploy the parachute, which will require further testing.

<h4>Payloads</h4>

Each payload sub team is currently undergoing more prototyping and testing, and all teams are working to send a final 3U Cubesat (three unit cubesat) into the air. If you would like to view the most recent updates for Payloads and other subteams, please keep up on our social media platforms: <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/ubcrocket" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/ubcrocket" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href = "https://www.twitter.com/ubcrocket" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
